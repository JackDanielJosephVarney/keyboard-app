## About

** *The apps background flashes* **

Keyboard app I made using React and the web audio api.

Will work with your keyboard and your mouse.

White keys are keyboard row *z-/* and *q-p* - black keys are the rows above them.

**Best viewed on desktop** but tested to work on a variety of screen sizes - however the api might not work correctly on every device.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App...](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
